			<p>You may not be able to access MetaMask, its features, or the wallet account you have created there in a variety of circumstances. The browser extension must function properly, your device must have adequate internet connectivity, and the login credentials you are providing must be accurate in order to use MetaMask. Therefore, if you want to sign in to your MetaMask account without any problems, you should definitely check all of this before attempting any other method.</p>

<p>However, there are some additional steps you can take in order to make sure that you can easily regain access to your account.</p>

Therefore, the first thing you need to do is sit tight and allow the MetaMask servers to restart. After that, you can try logging in using the appropriate MetaMask login information.</p>
